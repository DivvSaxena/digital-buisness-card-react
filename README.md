# My Digital Business Card - React Project

Welcome to my Digital Business Card project! This project was created after spending two days learning about React, JSX, custom components, and deploying it using Vite - React. In this README, I will provide an overview of the project and how you can access it. I am open to any suggestions or improvements you may have, so feel free to reach out to me!

## Why React?

I chose React for this project for several reasons:

1. **Declarative**: React allows for a more straightforward and intuitive way of building user interfaces by letting you declare how your UI should look at any given moment, rather than imperatively manipulating it.

2. **JSX**: JSX makes it easy to write and visualize the structure of your UI components, mixing HTML-like syntax with JavaScript.

3. **Custom Components**: React's component-based architecture promotes reusability and maintainability by allowing you to create custom components for different parts of your application.

## Project Overview

This Digital Business Card project is a simple web application that serves as my online business card. It contains information about me, links to my social media profiles, and ways to contact me. Here's what you can find on my digital business card:
